# AI Training Autopilot

Autopilot is a Kubernetes-native daemon that continuously monitors and evaluates GPUs, network and storage health, designed to detect and report infrastructure-level issues during the lifetime of AI workloads. It is an open-source project developed by IBM Research.

In AI training jobs, which may run for weeks or months, anomalies in the GPUs and network can happen anytime and often go undetected. In this case, performance degrades suddenly and a deep diagnostic is needed to identify the root cause, delaying or deleting the current job. Similarly, hardware anomalies can greatly disrupt the throughput and latency of an AI inference server.

The role of Autopilot is to detect and report any problems that are detected during the lifetime of the job and the existence of a cluster.

It implements a set of health checks evaluating the status of the system. These health checks focus mainly on subtle/software issues (i.e., row-remapping or PCIe link degradation), but also run connectivity tests (i.e., ping, iperf) to verify that secondary NICs are reachable. It can also verify that persistent volume claims (PVC) creation is functional for a given storage class.

Autopilot is deployed as a Kubernetes DaemonSet on all worker nodes that have GPUs. Each pod exposes a Service that can be accessed through RESTful API to request the execution of health checks. Therefore, each health check has its own entry point, but also a generic “status” entry point is provided.

The DaemonSet does not run as privileged and requires access to GPUs without requesting them as resources. Therefore, the GPUs are seen as available by the scheduler.

The main code is written in Go, while health checks are written in a combination of Python, Go, bash and CUDA. Each Autopilot pod runs health checks only on the node it resides. A pod can request other pods to run health checks on their nodes, and in that case, results are gathered and showed by the requestor pod.

If Autopilot requires full access to GPUs to run more invasive workloads, it will spawn a separate job with resources requests and limits set.

The toolkit currently provides health checks for pre-flight and post-flight phases, while in-flight checks will be enabled in the future. In more details (list subject to change):

- pre-flight checks

  - validate infrastructure before the start of jobs

- in-flight checks

  - workload and system performance is continuously monitored

  - detect anomaly, and issue notification

  - controllers can take actions if errors are found

- post-flight checks

  - validate infrastructure once the job ends

## Health Checks

The current status of Autopilot includes:

- **GPU PCIe Link Bandwidth**: The PCIe NVidia bandwidth test to check host-to-device connection on each node
- **GPU Memory**: GPUs remapped rows evaluation through `nvidia-smi`
- **GPU Memory Bandwidth Performance**: GPUs memory bandwidth evaluation through DAXPY and DGEMM
- **GPU Diagnostics**: NVidia DCGM (Data Center GPU Manager) diagnostics through `dcgmi diag`
- **GPU Power Slowdown**: verify if power throttle is active through `nvidia-smi`
- **Network Reachability**: `ping` to evaluate hosts reachability
- **Network Bandwidth**: `iperf3` to evaluate network bandwidth and hosts connectivity
- **PVC Create/Delete**: given a storageclass, test the ability to successfully provision a Persistent Volume Claim
- **DCGM level 3**: deep diagnostics through NVidia DCGM tool. This test runs as a separate Job that reserves all the GPUs in the node if they are free

A subset of the tests is enabled by default, and they run by default every hour. Both the the list of health checks and the timer can be customized at initialization time.

By default, the periodic checks list contains PCIe, rows remapping, GPUs power, DCGM level 1 and ping.

Results from health checks are exported as Prometheus Gauges, so that users and admins can easily check the status of the system on Grafana.

## Deep Diagnostics and Node Labeling

Autopilot runs health checks periodically and labels the nodes with `autopilot.ibm.com/gpuhealth: ERR` is any of the GPU health checks returns an error. Otherwise, health is set as `PASS`.

Also, more extensive tests, namely DCGM diagnostics level 3, are also executed automatically only on nodes that have free GPUs. This deeper analysis is needed to reveal problems in the GPUs that can be found only after running level 3 DCGM diagnostic.
This type of diagnostics can help deciding if the worker node should be used for running workloads or not. To facilitate this task, Autopilot will label nodes with key `autopilot.ibm.com/dcgm.level.3`.

If errors are found, the label `autopilot.ibm.com/dcgm.level.3` will contain the value `ERR`, a timestamp, the test(s) that failed and the GPU id(s) if available. Otherwise, the value is set to `PASS_timestamp`.

### Logs and Metrics

All health checks results are exported through Prometheus, but they can be also found in each pod's logs.

All metrics are accessible through Prometheus and Grafana dashboards. The gauge exposed is `autopilot_health_checks` and can be customized with the following filters:

- `check`, select one or more specific health checks
- `node`, filter by node name
- `cpumodel` and `gpumodel`, for heterogeneous clusters
- `deviceid` to select specific GPUs, when available

## Install Autopilot

Autopilot can be installed through Helm and need admin privileges to create objects like services, serviceaccounts, namespaces and relevant RBAC.

**NOTE**: this install procedure does NOT allow the use of `--create-namespace` or `--namespace=autopilot` in the `helm` command. This is because our helm chart, creates a namespace with a label, namely, we are creating a namespace with the label `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"`, so that Prometheus can scrape metrics. This applies to OpenShift clusters **only**. It is not possible, in Helm, to create namespaces with labels or annotations through the `--create-namespace` parameter, so we decided to create the namespace ourselves.

Therefore, we recommend one of the following options, which are mutually exclusive:

- Option 1: use `--create-namespace` with `--namespace=autopilot` in the helm cli AND disable namespace creation in the helm chart config file `namespace.create=false`. **If on OpenShift**, then manually label the namespace for Prometheus with `label ns autopilot "openshift.io/cluster-monitoring"=`.
- Option 2: use `namespace.create=true` in the helm chart config file BUT NOT use `--create-namespace` in the helm cli. Can still use `--namespace` in the helm cli but it should be set to something else (i.e., `default`).
- Option 3: create the namespace by hand `kubectl create namespace autopilot`, use `--namespace autopilot` in the helm cli and set `namespace.create=false` in the helm config file. **If on OpenShift**, then manually label the namespace for Prometheus with `label ns autopilot "openshift.io/cluster-monitoring"=`.

In the next release, we will remove the namespace from the Helm templates and will add OpenShift-only configurations separately.

### Requirements

- Need to install `helm-git` plugin

```bash
helm plugin install https://github.com/aslafy-z/helm-git --version 0.15.1
```

### Helm Chart customization

Helm charts values and how-to for customization can be found [here](https://github.com/IBM/autopilot/tree/main/autopilot-daemon/helm-charts/autopilot).

### Install

1) Add autopilot repo

```bash
helm repo add autopilot git+https://github.com/IBM/autopilot.git@autopilot-daemon/helm-charts/autopilot?ref=gh-pages
```

2) Install autopilot (idempotent command). The config file is for customizing the helm values. Namespace is where the helm chart will live, not the namespace where Autopilot runs

```bash
helm upgrade autopilot autopilot/autopilot --install --namespace=<default> -f your-config.yml
```

The controllers should show up in the selected namespace

```bash
kubectl get po -n autopilot
```

```bash
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
autopilot-daemon-autopilot-g7j6h   1/1     Running   0          70m
autopilot-daemon-autopilot-g822n   1/1     Running   0          70m
autopilot-daemon-autopilot-x6h8d   1/1     Running   0          70m
autopilot-daemon-autopilot-xhntv   1/1     Running   0          70m
```

### Uninstall

```bash
 helm uninstall autopilot # -n <default>
```

## Manually Query the Autopilot Service

Autopilot provides a `/status` handler that can be queried to get the entire system status, meaning that it will run all the tests on all the nodes. Autopilot is reachable by service name `autopilot-healthchecks.autopilot.svc` in-cluster only, meaning it can be reached from a pod running in the cluster, or through port forwarding (see below).

Health check names are `pciebw`, `dcgm`, `remapped`, `ping`, `iperf`, `pvc`, `gpumem`.

For example, using port forwarding to localhost or by exposing the service

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/autopilot-healthchecks 3333:3333 -n autopilot
# or kubectl expose service autopilot-healthchecks -n autopilot
```

If using port forward, then launch `curl` on another terminal

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3333/status?check=pciebw&host=nodename1"
```

Alternatively, retrieve the route with `kubectl get routes autopilot-healthchecks -n autopilot`

```bash
curl "http://<route-name>/status?check=pciebw&host=nodename1"
```

All tests can be tailored by a combination of:

- `host=<hostname1,hostname2,...>`, to run all tests on a specific node or on a comma separated list of nodes.
- `check=<healthcheck1,healtcheck2,...>`, to run a single test (`pciebw`, `dcgm`, `remapped`, `gpumem`, `ping`, `iperf` or `all`) or a list of comma separated tests. When no parameters are specified, only `pciebw`, `dcgm`, `remapped`, `ping` tests are run.
- `batch=<#hosts>`, how many hosts to check at a single moment. Requests to the batch are run in parallel asynchronously. Batching is done to avoid running too many requests in parallel when the number of worker nodes increases. Defaults to all nodes.

Some health checks provide further customization.

### DCGM

This test runs `dcgmi diag`, and we support only `r` as [parameter](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/dcgm/latest/user-guide/dcgm-diagnostics.html#command-line-options).

The default is `1`, but can customize it by `/status?check=dcgm&r=2`.

### Network Bandwidth Validation with IPERF

As part of this workload, Autopilot will generate the Ring Workload and then start `iperf3 servers` on each interface on each Autopilot pod based on the configuration options provided by the user.  Only after the `iperf3 servers` are started, Autopilot will begin executing the workload by starting `iperf3 clients` based on the configuration options provided by the user. All results are logged back to the user.

- For each network interface on each node, an `iperf3 server` is started. The number of `iperf3 servers` is dependent on the `number of clients` intended on being run. For example, if the  `number of clients` is `8`, then there will be `8` `iperf3 servers` started per interface on a unique `port`.

- For each timestep, all `pairs` are executed simultaneously. For each pair some `number of clients` are started in parallel and will run for `5 seconds` using `zero-copies` against a respective `iperf3 server`
- Metrics such `minimum`, `maximum`, `mean`, `aggregate` bitrates and transfers are tracked. The results are stored both as `JSON` in the respective `pod` as well as summarized and dumped into the `pod logs`.
- Invocation from the exposed Autopilot API is as follows below:

```bash
# Invoked via the `status` handle:
curl "http://autopilot-healthchecks-autopilot.<domain>/status?check=iperf&workload=ring&pclients=<NUMBER_OF_IPERF3_CLIENTS>&startport=<STARTING_IPERF3_SERVER_PORT>"

# Invoked via the `iperf` handle directly:
curl "http://autopilot-healthchecks-autopilot.<domain>/iperf?workload=ring&pclients=<NUMBER_OF_IPERF3_CLIENTS>&startport=<STARTING_IPERF3_SERVER_PORT>"
```

### Concrete Example

In this example, we target one node and check the pcie bandwidth and use the port-forwarding method.
In this scenario, we have a value lower than `8GB/s`, which results in an alert. This error will be exported to the OpenShift web console and on Slack, if that is enabled by admins.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:3333/status?check=pciebw"
```

The output of the command above, will be similar to the following (edited to save space):

```bash
