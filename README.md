# AI Training Autopilot
The goal of this challenge is to enable the OpenShift container platform to become the premier platform to orchestrate the full life cycle of Foundation Model workflows (pre-processing, training, adaptation/distillation, and inference) seamlessly across public, private, and on-prem cloud environments.

From operation perspective, infrastructure stability is always important. We actually saw the various errors and anomaly states in GPU and Network, for instance, so it becomes crucial to provide a tool to detect, avoid, and handle the infrastructure issues while running the AI training job. 

We provide a collection of tools (named Autopilot) to steer and address these infrastructure issues automatically by pre-flight checks, in-flight checks, and also post-flight to learn or improve the issue detection logic. 

Autopilot runs as a DaemonSet on all worker nodes that have GPUs. All results from health checks are exposed through Prometheus and a Grafana dashboard is available in the `utility-tools` folder.

The toolkit currently provides health checks for pre-flight and post-flight phases, while in-flight checks will be enabled in the future. In more details (list subject to change):

- pre-flight checks

  - validate infrastructure before the start of jobs

- in-flight checks

  - workload and system performance is continuously monitored

  - detect anomaly, decide to continue or stop the job

  - issue alert to end users

- post-flight checks

  - validate infrastructure once the job ends

# Health Checks
The current status of Autopilot includes:

- **GPU PCIe Link Bandwidth**: The PCIe NVidia bandwidth test to check host-to-device connection on each node
- **GPU Memory**: GPUs remapped rows evaluation through `nvidia-smi`
- **GPU Memory Bandwidth Performance**: GPUs memory bandwidth evaluation through DAXPY and DGEMM
- **GPU Diagnostics**: NVidia DCGM (Data Center GPU Manager) diagnostics through `dcgmi diag`
- **GPU Power Slowdown**: verify if power throttle is active through `nvidia-smi`
- **Network Reachability**: `ping` to evaluate hosts reachability
- **Network Bandwidth**: `iperf3` to evaluate network bandwidth and hosts connectivity

All test except `iperf3` are executed periodically every hour by default. The time frame can be customized during installation.

## Query the Autopilot Service

Autopilot provides a `/status` handler that can be queried to get the entire system status, meaning that it will run all the tests on all the nodes. Autopilot is reachable by service name `autopilot-healthchecks.autopilot.svc` in-cluster only, meaning it can be reached from a pod running in the cluster, or through port forwarding (see below).

Health check names are `pciebw`, `dcgm`, `remapped`, `ping`, `iperf`.

For example, using port forwarding to localhost and `curl`

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3333/status?check=pciebw&host=nodename1"
```

All tests can be tailored by a combination of:

- `host=<hostname1,hostname2,...>`, to run all tests on a specific node or on a comma separated list of nodes.
- `check=<healthcheck1,healtcheck2,...>`, to run a single test (`pciebw`, `dcgm`, `remapped`, `gpumem`, `ping`, `iperf` or `all`) or a list of comma separated tests. When no parameters are specified, only `pciebw`, `dcgm`, `remapped`, `ping` tests are run.
- `batch=<#hosts>`, how many hosts to check at a single moment. Requests to the batch are run in parallel asynchronously. Batching is done to avoid running too many requests in parallel when the number of worker nodes increases. Defaults to all nodes.

Some health checks provide further customization.

### DCGM
This test runs `dcgmi diag`, and we support only `r` as (parameter)[https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/dcgm/latest/user-guide/dcgm-diagnostics.html#command-line-options]. 

The default is `1`, but can customize it by `/status?check=dcgm&r=2`.

### IPERF 
This tests runs from a client node, which

- Issues several RPCs to start remote `iperf3` servers
- Launches a certain number of clients towards each of those servers

Both can be customized.
- `serverspernode` can be used to create a certain number of servers on each remote node.
  - if the value is lower than the number of secondary network interfaces, it will create the minimum number of `1` server per interface (excludes `eth0` and `lo`). Each server runs on a separate port.
  - otherwise, it will divide that value by the number of network interfaces existing in the cluster.
- `clientsperiface` can be used to launch a desired number of clients against a single remote server.

Another possible customization is to decide which network plane to test. By default is `data` plane, that is, what runs on secondary interfaces.

To test connection on `eth0`, that is, the management plane (`mgmt`), can use the `plane` parameter as follows `/status?check=iperf&plane=mgmt`.
It will create only one client and there is a single server per node.

## Run Health Checks

Health checks can be executed through a utility tool provided with a Helm chart, or by querying the Autopilot service.
Results can be visualized by either checking the logs of the utility tool/service query, or by looking at the data in a Prometheus dashboard.
Metrics are exposed through the `autopilot_health_checks` gauge, and health checks can be selected through the keyword `health` and any of the health checks provided (except from `iperf`).

An example is:

```bash
autopilot_health_checks{health=~"pciebw"}
```

### Query with Port-Forward

Alternatively, it is possible to port-forward the autopilot healthchecks Service and `curl` from localhost.

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/autopilot-healthchecks 3333:3333 -n autopilot
```

Will print the following output:

```bash
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3333 -> 3333
Forwarding from [::1]:3333 -> 3333
```

Then on another terminal, run the desired curl command. In this example, we target one node and check the pcie bandwidth.
In this scenario, we have a value lower than `8GB/s`, which results in an alert. This error will be exported to the OpenShift web console and on Slack, if that is enabled by admins.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:3333/status?check=pciebw"
```

The output of the command above, will be similar to the following (edited to save space):
```bash
Checking status on all nodes
Autopilot Endpoint: 10.128.6.187
Node: hostname
url(s): http://10.128.6.187:3333/status?host=hostname&check=pciebw
Response:

Autopilot Endpoint: 10.131.4.93
Node: hostname2
url(s): http://10.131.4.93:3333/status?host=hostname2&check=pciebw
Response:

[[ PCIEBW ]] Briefings completed. Continue with PCIe Bandwidth evaluation.
[[ PCIEBW ]] SUCCESS

Node Status: Ok
-------------------------------------

Node Summary:

{'hostname': ['PCIE Failed'],
 'hostname2': ['Ok']}

runtime: 31.845192193984985 sec
```

### Query from a pod
In the example below, we create a utility `nginx` pod from which we can run `curl` commands against the `autopilot-healthchecks` service.
We run the PCIe bandwidth test on all nodes, and we can see it is failing on one node.

Create a dummy nginx pod:

```bash
kubectl create job curl-pod --image=nginx -- sleep inf
```

Then run an health check:

```bash
kubectl exec jobs/curl-pod -- curl "http://autopilot-healthchecks.autopilot.svc:3333/status?check=pciebw"
```

# Install autopilot (Admin)
**Installation**: Autopilot can be installed through Helm and need admin privileges to create objects like services, serviceaccounts, namespaces and relevant RBAC.

## Requirements

- Need to install `helm-git` plugin on all hosts

```bash
helm plugin install https://github.com/aslafy-z/helm-git --version 0.15.1
```

## Helm Chart customization

Helm charts values can be found [here](https://github.com/IBM/autopilot/tree/main/autopilot-daemon/helm-charts/autopilot).

By default, it will create a namespace named `autopilot` where to run the components. Users workloads do not run in the autopilot namespace. The creation of the namespace can be disabled by setting `create` to false in the namespace block of the `Values.yaml` file.

```yaml
namespace: 
  create: true
  name: autopilot
```

If you do not want to create a new namespace and use an existing one, then set `create: false` and specify the namespace name.
On OpenShift, please ntice that you **must** label the namespace `oc label ns <namespace> openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true` to have Prometheus scrape metrics from Autopilot.

- To pull the image from a private registry, the admin needs to add `imagePullSecret` data in one of the helm charts. It is possible to avoid the creation of the pull secret by setting the value `create` to false in the imagePullSecret block, and by setting the name of the one that will be used (i.e., `autopilot-pull-secret`).

```yaml
pullSecrets:
  create: true
  name: autopilot-pull-secret
  imagePullSecretData: <encoded-key>
```

- Autopilot runs tests periodically. The default is set to every hour, but it can be customized be changing the following

```yaml
repeat: <hours>
```

- PCIe bandwidth critical value is defaulted to 4GB/s. It can be customized by changing the following

```yaml
PCIeBW: <val>
```

- If secondary nics are available by, for instance, Multus or Multi-Nic-Operator, those can be enabled in autopilot by setting the following

```yaml
annotations:
  k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: <network-config-name>
```

All these values can be saved in a `config.yaml` file, which can be passed to `helm`.
An example (the image repository and tag are set by default to the ones in this example):

```yaml
namespace:
  create: true
  name: autopilot

image:
  repository: your-repo/autopilot/autopilot
  tag: preferred-tag

pullSecrets:
  create: true
  name: autopilot-pull-secret
  imagePullSecretData: <encoded-key>

annotations:
  k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: multi-nic-config
```

## Build the container

It is possible to build and push the image through 

```bash
make image
```

You will need to change the `IMAGE` and `TAG` environment variables to fit your needs.

## Install

1) Add autopilot repo, here is where it checks for ssh keys

```bash
helm repo add autopilot git+https://github.com/IBM/autopilot.git@autopilot-daemon/helm-charts/autopilot?ref=gh-pages
```

or with ssh keys if preferred

```bash
helm repo add autopilot git+ssh://git@github.com/IBM/autopilot@autopilot-daemon/helm-charts/autopilot?ref=gh-pages
```

2) Install autopilot (idempotent command). The config file is for customizing the helm values. Namespace is where the helm chart will live, not the namespace where Autopilot runs

```bash
helm upgrade autopilot autopilot/autopilot-daemon --install --namespace=<default> -f your-config.yml
```

The controllers should show up in the selected namespace

```bash
oc get po -n autopilot
```

```bash
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
autopilot-daemon-autopilot-g7j6h   1/1     Running   0          70m
autopilot-daemon-autopilot-g822n   1/1     Running   0          70m
autopilot-daemon-autopilot-x6h8d   1/1     Running   0          70m
autopilot-daemon-autopilot-xhntv   1/1     Running   0          70m
```

## Uninstall

```bash
 helm uninstall autopilot % -n <namespace-where-chart-resides>
```
