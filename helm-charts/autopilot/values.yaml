# Bandwidth threshold below which PCIe links are considered defective (Gb/s)
# It is recommended to set a threshold that is 25% or lower of the expected peak PCIe bandwidth capability, which maps to maximum peak from 16 lanes to 4 lanes. For example, for a PCIe Gen4x16, reported peak bandwidth is 63GB/s. A degradation at 25% is 15.75GB/s, which corresponds to PCIe Gen4x4. The measured bandwidth is expected to be at least 80% of the expected peak PCIe generation bandwidth.
